Revisist FileSaveHelper - need a more integrated version
    -- idea.  No super integrated version.. just delete the extra stuff and add file conversions to a utility class of sorts
    --BETTER IDEA - MAKE FILESAVEHELPER ITS OWN COCOAPOD

Add functionality for saving file in a specific place in explorer - where to we enter file name?
    -- idea.  Click folder = open folder.  Save button always next to cancel.  Save creates alert view to enter the name
^ in a default place without opening explorer
open files with explorer
open files without explorer

How is bundle handled when in a CocoaPod?
Figure out best way to handle select (press select, select and confirm in toolbar, etc.)
Does user supply images?
